# MouseyBird

## A simple JS game for a school project

Assignment goal:

* Make a game in javascript

* Make said game somewhat fun to play

* Don't plagarize a previous game too hard

Our group came up with MouseyBird, flappy bird but you control the bird's flight through your mouse cursor.

Now, because this would be too easy, we've come up with several ideas on how to make it a rage-game instead of a snooze fest:

1. Pipes can now come from both the top and bottom

1. A pipe's height can oscilate up and down at random speeds

1. The bird still flaps, but at a different speed depending on how close the cursor is to the bird

1. Enemies try to shoot the bird with lasers

And a few more we didn't get to write down

**This game is built with the [CodeHS](codehs.com) Graphical-JS codebase in mind, meaning this will ___not___ run as a standalone program**
